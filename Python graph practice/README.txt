About:

This python exercise deals with important graph data structure concepts
and algorithms such as breadth-first search, nodes, edges, paths and 
recursive depth-first search. 

Procedure:
1) Create a text file that contains a list of names of people and their info
according to the format layed out by email.txt
2) Run the Driver_Program.py which uses functions in SocialNetwork.py. You can find
the friends of a person, the degree of separation between 2 people, listing all the 
people that relates to the person in question by a certain degree, list all the mutual
friends and classmates of a person and get the list of missing friends of a 
particular person. This is explained in detail in the query function's docstrings
in Driver_Program.py.
