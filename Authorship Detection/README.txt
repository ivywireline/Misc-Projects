About:

This project aims to identify the authors of unknown works. There are mysterious files,
author_function.py, author_program.py and .stat files in the repository. Python 3.3 or above is required
in order to run author_program.py. 

Procedure:

1) Git clone the link provided in the repository.
2) Open and run the author_program.py in a Python IDE or Shell.
3) Type in one of the mysterious files names with .txt extension. E.g.
 
>>> Enter the name of the file with unknown author: mystery1.txt

4) Type in the directory where the author's signature .stat files are located. E.g.

>>> Enter the path to the directory of signature files: C:\Users\STEVEN\Desktop\Authorship detection\Signature Files

5) Wait for the execution to be finished. Due to the fact that each mysterious file contains
a whole novel, the execution may take 1 or 2 hours and even more depending on the computer.
